# Moving this blog to WordPress

I'm in the process of moving the posts from this blog to the WordPress site that hosts my company's website.  
There are a number of reasons for this but the primary is that my blogging experiment seems to be successful 
(in other words, I'm still writing posts) and this should allow me to combine my personal interest in blogging 
about programming with my professional interests in attracting visitors to my company's site.

My plan is to truncate the blog posts here with a `more` link at the bottom of each post that will direct the
reader to finish the article on my primary site.  New posts may get the same treatment as this will help me with
my goal to accrue daily github commits.
