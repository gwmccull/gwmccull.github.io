# How-To Set Up the Babel Plugin in WebStorm

I've been enjoying programming in ECMAScript 6 recently.  I use the Babel plugin for WebStorm to compile the ES6 code down
to ES5 code that can be run in the browser.

But I always have trouble remembering how to set up the plugin and I haven't tried setting up Babel on a permanent basis
because I wasn't sure if I'd continue using it (versus Traceur).

For my reference (and yours, if you choose), here's how to set up Babel:
1. Create a Scope
2. Set JavaScript version
3. Set up file watcher
