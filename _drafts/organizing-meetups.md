I run a couple groups and I've been to an Angular group so I have some general advice.

Probably the most important thing is picking a consistent time and place to hold the meeting.  You want something that is central to a lot of people and is comfortable for the type of meeting you're holding (small groups, lecture, etc).  I hold one of my meetings at a restaurant with a conference room.  They give us a deal on the food and attendees buy drinks which makes up the difference.  

Be careful when you pick your time.  If it's too late in the day, people have gone home and may not want to go back out.  Too early and people may still be at work.  If it's dinner/lunch time, you need a place with food.

Consistency is important because you want people to get in the habit of coming to your meetings.  A lot of meetings are held on monthly (for example, 3rd Wednesday of every month) which is nice for big meetings.  If you're doing more of a working group or a place for people to work on projects, you might meet weekly or multiple times per week.

All of the groups that I've been to see a big initial rush of enthusiasm and then attendance severely drops off before it eventually levels out somewhere in between.  As the organizer, you have to be consistent through these changes in membership and address real complaints without changing the things that keep the core members coming back.

Pick the format:  You could have a big lecture-type meeting with a speaker doing a presentation but then you have to organize a speaker. If it's a famous speaker, you may need to pay them.  Some groups you may be able to pull the speaker from the group.  

I've been to one meeting that was organized as a working group.  The group picked a project and every week they talk about the next piece of the project and work on implementing it in their own time.

You could also have a meeting that is just space for people to come in and work on their own projects and get help.

Let me know if you have any questions.ï»¿
