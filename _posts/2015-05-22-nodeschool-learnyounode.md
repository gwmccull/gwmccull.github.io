title: NodeSchool Learnyounode Exercises
---

As mentioned in my [last post](http://mcculloughwebservices.com/2015/05/20/nodeschool-javascripting-exercises/), I'll be helping  teach the [Learnyounode exercises](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) from [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) this weekend (5/23/2015). 

In preparation for tomorrow's workshop, I completed the Learnyounode exercises last night.  Learnyounode is a series 
of 13 exercises designed to teach the student about [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).  The exercises start very basic
but quickly get fairly challenging.  None of the exercises are long, but they do involve concepts, like streams,
that many developers are probably not familiar with.  The exercises make use of libraries where necessary but, where possible,
encourage the student to do it the "hard way" before relying on libraries to make the exercises easier.
