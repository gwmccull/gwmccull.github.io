title: NodeSchool Learnyounode Exercises
---

As mentioned in my [last post](/2015/05/20/nodeschool-javascripting/), I'll be helping  teach the 
[Learnyounode exercises](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) from [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/) this weekend (5/23/2015). 

In preparation for tomorrow's workshop, I completed the Learnyounode exercises last night.  Learnyounode is a series 
of 13 exercises designed to teach the student about [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).  The exercises start very basic
but quickly get fairly challenging.  None of the exercises are long, but they do involve concepts, like streams,
that many developers are probably not familiar with.  The exercises make use of libraries where necessary but, where possible,
encourage the student to do it the "hard way" before relying on libraries to make the exercises easier.

Iâ€™ve uploaded all of my answers into a repo, in case anyone would like to see them:

I've done a number of projects in NodeJS but I was always building APIs with ExpressJS.  Several of the Learnyounode exercises
involved file I/O, which was new to me, and the API exercises were done using only the HTTP library.

I liked these exercises a little more than the NodeSchool Javascripting exercises.  While they didn't explicitly cover
the "why" of programming, once you start serving files, process performing file I/O and grabbing data from APIs, you can
start to imagine how programming could be used.
