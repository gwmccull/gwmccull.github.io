I've decided to take the advice of a number of folks and start blogging about the things I'm learning about.  The idea
being that blogging will serve as a future reference and record for things that I've learned over the years.

A little about me, I'm a UI/UX developer at [Clear Capital](http://www.clearcapital.com).  I primarily code in AngularJS, 
HTML, and CSS.  I moved into this position a couple months ago.  My former position was Web Application Developer.  
I was doing full stack development in ColdFusion and AngularJS.

In my own time, I program in Angular, and NodeJS.  I'm currently working my way, slowly, through a Swift iOS8 course.
I took a course a year ago on MongoDB, and I've done a couple projects with it.

A few weeks ago, I participated in the [2015 Reno NASA Space Apps](http://spaceappsreno.org/) challenge and built a 
[web app](https://github.com/SpaceAppsReno/solar-system) using Ionic.  That was a fun weekend and maybe I can write 
more about that later.

I'm looking to learn more about TypeScript and I think I may make that my next project.

I listen to a number of podcasts on my commute.  Of the ones related to code, I'm currently enjoying 
[JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/) and [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/) the most.  JavaScript
Jabber is an obvious podcast for me to listen to since I write so much JavaScript but CodeNewbie is less obvious.  I've
been programming for a number of years so I don't think I qualify as a newbie any more but they usually have fun topics
and it's interesting to hear how others got their start.

A quick word of thanks to [Joshua Lande's blog](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) for the tutorial on 
setting up [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
