I started working through the [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) exercises yesterday.  
Exercism is a site where people can complete coding challenges and have their work reviewed by other users of the site.
It's offered in a number of different languages and I understand that the exercises will start easy and get harder.

I completed the JavaScript 'Bob' exercise tonight.  It wasn't too difficult and it was kinda fun.  It involved a lot of
string manipulation which I don't really do at work so that exercised a few muscles I don't often use.
