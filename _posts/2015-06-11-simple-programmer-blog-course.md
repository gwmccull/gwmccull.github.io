# Better Blogging with the Simple Programmer

For the past couple weeks, I've been following along with the [course on blogging](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/) 
from the [Simple Programmer](http://simpleprogrammer.com).  It's a how-to-blog course where the lessons are emailed to 
you twice a week.  

Blogging is something I've been thinking about for a long time.  The idea was brought back around recently by a number
of the podcasts that I follow.  I think the act of writing about programming will help solidify the coding concepts
that I'm working on at work and in my spare time.  A lot of proponents of blogging also argue that blogging can be a big
boost to one's career.  That's not a big concern of mine but I suppose it might be nice to one day have someone thank me
for something that I wrote :-)

I'm on Lesson 5 of the blogging course, and so far, it's been pretty helpful.  The lessons are short.  There's generally
a short homework assignment in each lesson.  One of the homework assignments for this lesson was to write this blog post!

This lesson (and I'm sure future lessons) dealt with getting traffic to your
blog.  One of the recommendations was to engage in "link building" for 30-45 minutes each day!  Considering that this
blog is mostly for my own benefit, and traffic isn't really a concern, I doubt I'll do that portion of the lesson but
a lot of the other advice has been beneficial.

If you're interested in learning more about blogging, I'd definitely recommend [John Somnez's course](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/).
