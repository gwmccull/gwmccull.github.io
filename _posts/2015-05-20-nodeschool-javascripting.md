title: NodeSchool Javascripting Exercises
---

This weekend (5/23/2015), I'll be helping teach the [Javascripting exercises](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) 
from [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/).  The NodeSchool site has a series of free tutorials designed to teach JavaScript,
Node, Git, etc.  You may choose to work through the tutorials on your own or you can attend a NodeSchool workshop where
they'll help you through the exercises.  I believe NodeSchool workshops are generally free (or at least low cost).

In preparation for this weekend, I completed the Javascripting exercises.  These are beginner exercises designed to 
teach the student the very basics of programming in JavaScript.

I've uploaded all of my answers into a repo, in case anyone would like to see them:

I like these exercises because they assume the student has no prior knowledge of programming.  The only difficulty that 
I can see some people having is with setting up the environment and getting the necessary tools installed.  NodeSchool
has also been translated into a number of different languages (I count 18, including English).

The thing that I don't like about this tutorial is that, while it begins to answer the 'how', it does not address the
'why' of programming.  The tutorials do not have any information about why you should be interested in programming.  It
also doesn't seem to have a set of resources for students that have passed the tutorials and want to learn more.
