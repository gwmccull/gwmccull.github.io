title: NodeSchool Javascripting Exercises
---

This weekend (5/23/2015), I'll be helping teach the [Javascripting exercises](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) 
from [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/).  The NodeSchool site has a series of free tutorials designed to teach JavaScript,
Node, Git, etc.  You may choose to work through the tutorials on your own or you can attend a NodeSchool workshop where
they'll help you through the exercises.  I believe NodeSchool workshops are generally free (or at least low cost).

In preparation for this weekend, I completed the Javascripting exercises.  These are beginner exercises designed to 
teach the student the very basics of programming in JavaScript.
